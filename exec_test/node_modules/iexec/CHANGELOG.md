# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [6.0.0] 2021-07-19

### Added

- client-side (in browser) dataset encryption is now possible.
- confirms option allows to set the number of block to wait for transaction confirmation.
- `iexec app init --tee` init the TEE app template

### Changed

- [BREAKING] `iexec init` set default chain `viviani` (iExec sidecahin testnet) in `chain.json`, previously was `goerli` (using `--chain` option still overrides the `chain.json` configuration).
- [BREAKING] SCONE file system encryption is dropped in favor of AES-256-CBC for dataset encryption. Existing datasets will stop working, these datasets original files MUST be re-encrypted using `iexec dataset encrypt` and republished.
- [BREAKING] changed generated dataset keys and encrypted datasets files naming pattern.
- [BREAKING] a dataset is now a single file. in order to pass a tree structure, the dataset owner must package all the files in a single archive file, applications that previously used multiple files from a single dataset must handle unwrapping files from an archive file.
- [BREAKING] app `mrenclave` format changed from string to object previously deployed TEE apps must be rebuilt and redeployed with v6 workflow
- [BREAKING] `iexec.task.obsTask()` now returns `Promise<Observable>` previously it returned `Observabe`
- [BREAKING] `iexec.deal.obsDeal()` now returns `Promise<Observable>` previously it returned `Observabe`
- [DEPRECATED] `iexec wallet getETH` is now an alias to `iexec wallet get-ether` and will be removed in a next version
- [DEPRECATED] `iexec wallet getRLC` is now an alias to `iexec wallet get-RLC` and will be removed in a next version
- [DEPRECATED] `iexec wallet sendETH` is now an alias to `iexec wallet send-ether` and will be removed in a next version
- [DEPRECATED] `iexec wallet sendRLC` will be removed in a next version, use `iexec wallet send-RLC` BEWARE default unit is RLC!
- `chainId` is no longer required to call `IExec` constructor, the chainId is lazily fetched from the provider
- fix `iexec wallet send-ether` return sent `amount` in wei
- fix `fetchWorkerpoolOrderbook()` to include `requester` restricted workerpoolorders (fix `app run` using requester restricted workerpoolorder)
- fix `iexec app run` `--gas-price` option
- removed `mrenclave` from app default template
- `iexec appr run --watch` and `iexec deal show --watch` added tasks status details

### Removed

- [BREAKING] `--algorithm` option is removed from `iexec dataset encrypt`
- [BREAKING] removed `iexec.network.id` and `iexec.network.isSidechain`, use `iexec.network.getNetwork() => Promise<{chainId: String, isSidechain: Boolean}>`
- [BREAKING] tee post-compute configuration responsibility has been transferred to the SMS and is no longer supported by requestorder. any custom `iexec_tee_post_compute_image` and `iexec_tee_post_compute_fingerprint` will be silently removed from `requestorder.params`.
- [BREAKING] drop previously deprecated `iexec wallet show --raw` returned json key `balance.ETH`, use `balance.ether` instead
- [BREAKING] drop previously deprecated `bridge.bridgedChainId` in `chain.json` use `bridge.bridgedChainName` instead
