The Market is open for all entities willing to buy computations (Demands) or monetize computational resources (Offers). ## Yagna Market API The Yagna Market API is the entry to the Yagna Market through which Requestors and Providers can publish their Demands and Offers respectively, find matching counterparty, conduct negotiations and make an agreement.  This version of Market API conforms with capability level 1 of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zny_vfgWV-hcsKS7P-Kdr3Fb0dwfl-6T_cYKVQ9mkNg\"> Market API specification</a>.
